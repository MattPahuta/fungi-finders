              What do I need to start mushroom foraging?
            </h3>
            <p>
              You'll need a local field guide, a sharp knife or
              scissors, a basket or mesh bag for collecting, and paper
              bags for separating specimens. Bring a small brush for
              cleaning, wear sturdy boots, and carry a GPS device or
              compass to track your location. A camera is also helpful
              to document your finds.

              How can I identify edible mushrooms?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Learn from experienced foragers and reliable guidebooks
              – never rely on apps alone. Study each mushroom's
              specific features like cap shape, gill structure, stem
              characteristics, and spore prints. Start with easily
              identifiable species that have no poisonous lookalikes,
              and never eat anything unless you're completely certain
              of its identification.

              Where can I find foraging spots?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Look in deciduous forests, especially near oak and maple
              trees, and in damp, shaded areas. Fallen logs and dead
              trees are often productive spots. Only forage on public
              lands where it's allowed, and always check local
              regulations. Remember to get permission for private
              property and keep your best locations private to prevent
              over-harvesting..

              What are the best seasons for mushroom foraging?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Spring is ideal for morels, late summer brings
              chanterelles and boletes, and fall is peak season for
              most mushrooms including oysters and hen of the woods.
              Some species can even be found in winter, especially in
              milder climates. Each season offers different varieties,
              so year-round foraging is possible.
